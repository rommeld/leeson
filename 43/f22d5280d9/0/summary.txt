Here's a summary of what was implemented across 4 files:

**`src/tui/app.rs`** — Added three fields to `OrderBookState`:
- `is_stale: bool` — marks the book as having a checksum mismatch
- `checksum_failures: u8` — tracks consecutive failures for retry limiting
- `last_resync_request: Option<Instant>` — cooldown timer between resync attempts

**`src/tui/event.rs`** — Core verification logic:
- Added `Action::ResyncBook(String)` variant
- After every **incremental** update, calls `calculate_checksum()` and compares to the exchange's checksum
- On **mismatch**: sets `is_stale`, increments failure count, logs a warning, and returns `ResyncBook` if within retry limit (3) and cooldown (5s)
- On **match**: resets `is_stale` and failure count
- On **snapshot**: resets all staleness state (fresh data from exchange)

**`src/main.rs`** — Handles `ResyncBook` by unsubscribing then re-subscribing to the book channel, which triggers Kraken to send a fresh snapshot.

**`src/tui/tabs/trading_pair.rs`** — Shows a yellow `[STALE]` indicator on the order book border when checksum verification fails.
