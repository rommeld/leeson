The Rust error is pre-existing (visible in the git status showing modified `src/main.rs`) and unrelated to my Python changes. The ideation agent changes are purely Python and don't affect Rust compilation.

Here's a summary of what was done:

### Changes to `agents/multi_agent/agents/ideation_agent.py`

1. **Extracted `fetch_ohlc()` standalone function** (line 76) — The HTTP + formatting logic was moved out of the tool into a reusable async function that takes `symbol` and `interval` parameters.

2. **Simplified `get_ohlc` tool** (line 155) — Now a thin wrapper that delegates to `fetch_ohlc()`. Updated its docstring to clarify it's for fetching *additional* timeframes beyond what's already in the prompt.

3. **Pre-fetch in `run_periodic`** (line 220) — Uses `asyncio.gather` to fetch hourly OHLC data for all active pairs concurrently before invoking the LLM. Exceptions are caught per-pair via `return_exceptions=True`.

4. **Updated prompt** (line 235) — Embeds the pre-fetched OHLC data directly in the prompt text, tells the LLM the data is already provided, and mentions `get_ohlc` is available for additional timeframes.

5. **Updated system prompt** (line 46) — Changed from "Analyze OHLC data using the get_ohlc tool" to "Analyze the OHLC data provided in each prompt".
