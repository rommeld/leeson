Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Auto-fetch OHLC data before ideation agent analysis

## Context

Currently, the ideation agent relies on the LLM to call the `get_ohlc` tool for each active pair during its periodic run. This means:
- Multiple LLM round-trips (one tool call per pair)
- Extra tokens spent on tool-call overhead
- The LLM might skip fetching for some pairs

The goal is to fetch OHLC data programmatically for all active pairs **before** invoking the LLM, and include the data directly in the prompt so the agent can immediately analyze it.

## Changes

### File: `agents/multi_agent/agents/ideation_agent.py`

1. **Extract OHLC fetching into a standalone async function** — Move the core HTTP + formatting logic from the `get_ohlc` tool into a reusable `fetch_ohlc(symbol, interval)` function. The existing `get_ohlc` tool will call this function so it remains available if the LLM wants additional timeframes.

2. **Pre-fetch data in `run_periodic`** — Before calling the LLM, iterate over all active pairs and call `fetch_ohlc` concurrently (using `asyncio.gather`). Collect the formatted OHLC strings.

3. **Include pre-fetched data in the prompt** — Embed the OHLC data directly in the prompt text so the LLM has all the information it needs without making tool calls. Update the prompt wording to tell the agent the data is already provided rather than asking it to fetch data.

4. **Keep `get_ohlc` tool available** — The tool stays registered so the LLM can still fetch different intervals (e.g., 15-min or daily candles) if it wants deeper analysis on a specific pair.

## Verification

- `cargo check` — ensure Rust side is unaffected
- Manual review of the modified `run_periodic` function to confirm OHLC data is fetched for each active pair and included in the prompt
- Confirm the `get_ohlc` tool still works by verifying it delegates to the extracted function
