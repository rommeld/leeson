Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Cross-Platform Release Binary Builds

## Context

The project has an existing release workflow that bumps versions and creates GitHub Releases, but doesn't build or attach binaries. This plan adds a build workflow that automatically compiles release binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows, and attaches them to GitHub Releases so users can download and install them.

## Changes

### 1. Add release profile to `Cargo.toml`

Append at end of file:

```toml
[profile.release]
strip = true
lto = true
```

- `strip = true` — removes debug symbols, reducing binary size ~50-80%
- `lto = true` — link-time optimization for smaller/faster binaries (longer compile time, acceptable for releases)

### 2. Create `.github/workflows/build.yml`

New workflow that builds release binaries for 4 targets:

| Target | Runner | Archive |
|---|---|---|
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` (macOS ARM) | `macos-latest` | `.tar.gz` |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` (macOS Intel) | `macos-13` | `.tar.gz` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (Linux) | `ubuntu-latest` | `.tar.gz` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` (Windows) | `windows-latest` | `.zip` |

**Triggers:**
- `release: types: [published]` — automatically fires when existing `release.yml` creates a release
- `workflow_dispatch` with optional `tag` input — for manual/test builds

**Workflow structure:**
1. **`build` job** (matrix, 4 runners in parallel):
   - Checkout at release tag
   - Install stable Rust toolchain with target
   - `cargo build --release --target <target>` (no `python` feature)
   - Package binary + `risk.json` into archive (`tar.gz` or `zip`)
   - Generate SHA256 checksum
   - Upload as workflow artifact

2. **`publish` job** (runs after all builds, release events only):
   - Download all artifacts
   - Upload archives + checksums to the GitHub Release via `gh release upload`

**Archive contents:**
- `leeson` binary (or `leeson.exe`)
- `risk.json` (required at runtime)
- Note: `certs/gts_root_r4.pem` is NOT included — it's compiled into the binary via `include_bytes!`

**No changes to existing `release.yml`** — the event coupling is automatic.

## Files Modified

- `Cargo.toml` — add `[profile.release]` section
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — new file

## Verification

1. Run `cargo build --release` locally to confirm the release profile compiles
2. Push to a branch, trigger `build.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` to verify all 4 platform builds succeed
3. Cut a test release via `release.yml` and confirm `build.yml` fires automatically, attaching 8 assets (4 archives + 4 checksums) to the release
