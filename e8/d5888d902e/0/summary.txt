The fix is clean. Here's what was wrong and what changed:

**Root cause:** The workflow used `${{ steps.get-commit.outputs.message }}` directly inside `run:` scripts, which means GitHub Actions expands the expression *before* the shell executes. When the commit message contained backticks (`` `q` ``), the shell treated them as command substitution and tried to run `q` as a command.

**Fix:** Moved the commit message (and other step outputs) from inline `${{ }}` interpolation to `env:` blocks. When values are passed via `env:`, GitHub Actions sets them as environment variables without shell interpretation, so backticks, quotes, and other special characters are handled safely.

This is also a security best practice — inline `${{ }}` in `run:` blocks is a known script injection vector (GitHub's [security hardening guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#understanding-the-risk-of-script-injections) recommends using environment variables instead).
