Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Rewrite README.md Installation and Usage Sections

## Context

The current README has a minimal "Usage" section (lines 63-90) that only lists `cargo` commands and a brief Python extension example. It lacks prerequisites, configuration, environment variables, risk config setup, agent setup, simulation mode, TUI keybindings, and platform support — all of which are important for someone setting up the project.

The architecture diagram on line 13 also says "PyO3" for the agent connection, but agents actually communicate via JSON-lines over stdin/stdout pipes. PyO3 is a separate feature for using Rust types from Python directly.

## Changes

**File:** `README.md`

Replace the "Usage" section (lines 63-90) and fix the architecture diagram. Keep the title, description, and project structure sections unchanged.

### New content outline

1. **Fix architecture diagram** (line 11): Change `PyO3` label to `JSON-lines` or `stdio` since agents communicate via pipes, not PyO3. Add a note that PyO3 is available as a separate feature.

2. **Prerequisites** section:
   - Rust (stable, edition 2024)
   - Python 3.12+ and `uv` (for agents)
   - macOS (ARM64), Linux (x86_64), or Windows (x86_64)

3. **Configuration** section:
   - Environment variables table: `KRAKEN_API_KEY`, `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`, `KRAKEN_WEBSOCKET_URL`, `LEESON_SIMULATION`
   - Note: credentials can also be entered at runtime via the TUI (`a` key) or stored in macOS Keychain
   - `risk.json` — must exist in working directory, explain its purpose and format

4. **Building and Running** section:
   - `cargo build` / `cargo run`
   - Simulation mode: `LEESON_SIMULATION=true cargo run`
   - Agent spawning happens automatically from the TUI

5. **TUI Key Bindings** section:
   - Table of key bindings for navigation, agents, overlays

6. **Python Extension** section (keep but improve):
   - `maturin develop --release` with feature explanation
   - Brief usage example

7. **Development** section:
   - `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`

## Verification

- Read the final README.md to confirm formatting and accuracy
- Ensure no information contradicts the actual source code
