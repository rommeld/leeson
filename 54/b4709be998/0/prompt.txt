Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Require pair selection before ideation starts

## Context

The Ideation Agent runs on a 15-minute timer and analyzes OHLC data for `state.active_pairs`. Currently, if no pairs are selected, `run_periodic` silently returns early — giving no feedback to the operator. The agent should explicitly wait until pairs are selected before starting its first run, and pause again if all pairs are deselected.

## Approach

Use an `asyncio.Event` as a gate so the ideation loop blocks until at least one pair is selected.

## Changes

### 1. `agents/multi_agent/state.py` — Add `pairs_ready` event

Add an `asyncio.Event` field to `SharedState`:

```python
import asyncio

pairs_ready: asyncio.Event = field(default_factory=asyncio.Event)
```

This is safe because `SharedState` is created inside the async `run()` function.

### 2. `agents/multi_agent/orchestrator.py` — Set/clear event on pair updates

In `_route_stdin_messages`, when processing `active_pairs` messages, set or clear the event:

```python
elif msg_type == "active_pairs":
    state.active_pairs = msg.get("pairs", [])
    if state.active_pairs:
        state.pairs_ready.set()
    else:
        state.pairs_ready.clear()
    output_to_panel(...)
```

### 3. `agents/multi_agent/orchestrator.py` — Gate the ideation loop

Modify `_run_ideation_loop` to wait for the event before starting, and pause if pairs are deselected:

```python
async def _run_ideation_loop(deps, model):
    history = []
    output_to_panel(1, "[ideation] Waiting for pair selection...")
    await deps.state.pairs_ready.wait()
    output_to_panel(1, "[ideation] Pairs selected — starting analysis")

    while not deps.state.shutting_down:
        try:
            history = await ideation_agent.run_periodic(deps, history, model=model)
        except Exception:
            traceback.print_exc(file=sys.stderr)
            output_to_panel(1, "[ideation] [error] ...")

        await asyncio.sleep(IDEATION_INTERVAL)
        if deps.state.shutting_down:
            break

        # Pause if all pairs were deselected
        if not deps.state.active_pairs:
            output_to_panel(1, "[ideation] No active pairs — pausing")
            await deps.state.pairs_ready.wait()
            output_to_panel(1, "[ideation] Pairs selected — resuming analysis")
```

Key behavior changes:
- On startup: outputs "Waiting for pair selection..." and blocks until pairs are selected
- First run is immediate after pair selection (no 15-minute wait)
- If pairs are deselected mid-session, ideation pauses and resumes when pairs are re-selected
- The 15-minute sleep happens *after* each run, not before

## Files modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agents/multi_agent/state.py` | Add `pairs_ready: asyncio.Event` field |
| `agents/multi_agent/orchestrator.py` | Set/clear event on pair updates; gate ideation loop |

## Verification

1. `cargo build` — ensure Rust side still compiles (no Rust changes)
2. Start the system with no pairs selected → ideation panel shows "Waiting for pair selection..."
3. Select a pair → ideation runs immediately
4. Deselect all pairs → ideation pauses with "No active pairs — pausing"
5. Re-select pairs → ideation resumes
