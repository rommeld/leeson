Commit `546fd26` is clean. Only the unrelated `.entire/` config changes remain unstaged.

**Regarding key rotation:** I cannot rotate Kraken API keys programmatically — you need to do this manually:

1. Log in to **Kraken** → **Settings** → **API**
2. **Delete** the key pair starting with `kwZaKa+HEf...`
3. **Generate** a new key pair with the permissions you need
4. Set the new values as environment variables:
   ```
   export KRAKEN_API_KEY="<new-key>"
   export KRAKEN_API_SECRET="<new-secret>"
   ```

The old credentials in `config/config.toml` were never committed to git history (the `/config` directory was in `.gitignore`), so the exposure is limited to your local disk. Still, rotating is the safe move since the values were in a plaintext file.
