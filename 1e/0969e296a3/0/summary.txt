All 100 tests pass, plus all integration and doc tests. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Problem**: When the authenticated WebSocket connection failed but credentials were configured, the status bar still showed "Auth" in green. The operator had no indication that executions/balances channels were unavailable.

**Changes across 4 files:**

- **`app.rs`** — Added `private_connected: bool` field to `App`, initialized to `false`.

- **`event.rs`** — Added `PrivateChannelStatus(bool)` message variant. The handler sets `app.private_connected`. Also resets `private_connected = false` on `Disconnected` and `Reconnecting` messages.

- **`connection.rs`** — Sends `PrivateChannelStatus` at every state transition:
  - `true` when private WS connects and subscribes successfully
  - `false` when token fetch fails (with credentials configured), private connection fails, private ping fails, or private stream errors/ends mid-session

- **`status_bar.rs`** — Three-way auth display:
  - **No Auth** (dark gray) — no credentials configured
  - **Auth** (green) — private WebSocket connected
  - **Auth Down** (yellow) — credentials valid but private WebSocket unavailable
