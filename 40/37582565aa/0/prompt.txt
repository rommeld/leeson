I currently need to enter my password when I want to sign my commits. How do I change the config so I do not need to enter my password anymore?

Is there another way just using git?

I do not want to sign my commits anymore. Too much overhead.

check out the chances in my project. write commits. follow common git pattern. divide the commits by domaine.

update the README.md. describe the current project structure and functionality. avoid verbosity.
